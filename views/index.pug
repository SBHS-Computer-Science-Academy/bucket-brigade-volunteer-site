						The Santa Barbara Bucket Brigade formed as a community volunteer response to the tragic debris flow of January 9, 2018, which devastated the community of 
						Montecito in Santa Barbara County, CA. The disaster caused 23 fatalities and more than 150 injuries.  More than 100 homes were destroyed and an additional 
						400 homes were damaged. In the aftermath of this disaster the Bucket Brigade emerged from the mud, leading an army of caring neighbors to dig out homes, clear 
						and restore open spaces, restore old trails and blaze new ones to reconnect the community. The goal was simple: help our neighbors in their immediate time of 
						need. Despite the overwhelming grief, our collective instinct toward action kicked in and we started digging together.

						If you want to get more involved with Bucket Brigade, you can apply to join the Bucket Brigade Academy this summer. Bucket Brigade Academy prepares teens to be 
						leaders in their communities by teaching them how to organize, train, and deploy the power of community in response to natural disasters and crises. Academy 
						graduates will leave the programs with an understanding of the skills and abilities required to lead during a community crisis as well as to lead community 
						service projects here in Santa Barbara County and beyond. Learn more #[a(href="https://academy.sbbucketbrigade.org/" target="_paremt") here].
